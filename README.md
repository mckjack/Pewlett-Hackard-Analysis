# Pewlett Hackard Analysis 
## Purpose
The purpose of this analysis was to take a look at the data regarding the soon-to-be or already retired employees at Pewlett Hackard. By using SQL we were able to create 4 tables that give us better insight on the problems at Pewlett Hackard and finding trends to help us develop solutions to this. We were also able to export these 4 tables to their respective CSV files to save the information on hand and look back at it at a later time. 

## Results
From our analysis we are able to see that a good amount of employees are retiring in the coming years meaning that Pewlett Hackard has some work to do in rehiring for these positions. When we look at our table of just the names of the retiring employees with their respective titles.

Overall our analysis was very in-depth and looked at a lot of data to come to conclusions on what Pewlett Hackard should do to counter their retirement problem. The four takeaways from the analysis were, 
- There are 72,458 employees that are getting ready to retire which means that Pewlett Hackard will have to do something to counter this whether it's mentoring or hiring others.
- Hewlett Packard's most employeed postions of people getting ready to retire are the Senior Engineer and Senior Staff positions meaning that these positions must be maintained by either hiring young and working people up into these Senior positions.
- There are 2 manager positions that will be open soon due to retirement meaning that these positions should be focused on the most within the company and how will it be filled.
- Lastly, we were able to takeaway that the majority of the employees eligibile for the mentorship program are born in 1965 and will have to mentor more than 1 person per position due to the need of employees in their respective department. 

## Summary 
To summarize we needed to answer two questions. Is Pewlett Hackard ready for the silver tsunami and second do they have enough mentors. Overall, Pewlett Hackard is not ready for the silver tsunami simply due to the fact that they have a lot of older employees by our analysis meaning that these positions will soon need to be filled. Due to the fact that most positions are Senior Engineers, that means that Pewlett Hackard must either promote engineers currently employed and train them. However there are only 169 Senior Engineers eligible for the mentorship program meaning that it will be a lot of work since each Senior Engineer may have more than one pupil.

In the following image by using our knowledge of SQL, we are able to answer the question does Pewlett Hackard have enough employees to mentor the future. That answer is no for the meantime simply due to the fact that each mentor would have to take on multiple students therefore it could be sustainable to combat the employee demand but it does question how strong the future employees will be in their respective position.
